I am just another software developer who likes to

* Play games on my PC
* Capture moments using my phone camera
* Play various sports
* Read random tech articles
* Listen to unusual rhythmic songs
* Argue with others(not like Arnab though!)

# Developer.
By using this term I want to highlight that I have the analytical skills to find solutions to problems. I understand `technology`. I might not know how Facebook determines unusual activity but I know how sessions work, how data gets transferred from your mobile to your friends screen. Irrespective of the tech stack you are familiar with, being a developer helps in understanding problems in a different way.

# Artist.
I think anybody who can `communicate thoughts` using any medium is an artist. Good or bad is always relative. I find myself interested in many activities other than my professional work. Though I don't get enough time, I still try my hands-on whenever possible.

# Human.
I believe in only one religion - `Humanity`. I learned many things. I made mistakes. Even now I might be making one! But its all a part of the evolution. We are now because of how we managed to create large civilizations. Of course as everybody else I am still on my way to find the meaning of life.
